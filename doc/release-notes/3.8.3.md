# Release notes for Gluster 3.8.3

This is a bugfix release. The [Release Notes for 3.8.0](3.8.0.md),
[3.8.1](3.8.1.md) and [3.8.2](3.8.2.md) contain a listing of all the new
features that were added and bugs fixed in the GlusterFS 3.8 stable release.

## Out of Order release to address a severe usability regression

Due to a major regression that was not caught and reported by any of the
testing that has been performed, this release is done outside of the normal
schedule.

The main reason to release 3.8.3 earlier than planned is to fix [bug
1366813](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1366813):

> On restarting GlusterD or rebooting a GlusterFS server, only the bricks of
> the first volume get started. The bricks of the remaining volumes are not
> started. This is a regression caused by a change in GlusterFS-3.8.2.
>
> This regression breaks automatic start of volumes on rebooting servers, and
> leaves the volumes inoperable. GlusterFS volumes could be left in an
> inoperable state after upgrading to 3.8.2, as upgrading involves restarting
> GlusterD.
>
> Users can forcefully start the remaining volumes, by doing running the
> `gluster volume start <name> force` command.
