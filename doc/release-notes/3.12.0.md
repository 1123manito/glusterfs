### Feature one liner
Add option to use localtime timestamps in log entries

**Limitations:**

Gluster defaults to UTC timestamps. glusterd, glusterfsd, and server-side
glusterfs daemons will use UTC until one of a) command line option is
processed, b) gluster config (/var/lib/glusterd/options) is loaded,
c) admin manually sets localtime-logging (cluster.localtime-logging, e.g.
`gluster volume set all cluster.localtime-logging enable`).

There is no mount option to make the FUSE client enable localtime logging.

There is no option in gfapi to enable localtime logging.
