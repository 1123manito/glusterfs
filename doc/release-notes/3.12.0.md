**Known Issues:**


## Major issues
1. Expanding a gluster volume that is sharded may cause file corruption
    - Sharded volumes are typically used for VM images, if such volumes are
  expanded or possibly contracted (i.e add/remove bricks and rebalance) there
  are reports of VM images getting corrupted.
    - The last known cause for corruption (Bug #1465123) has a fix with this
  release. As further testing is still in progress, the issue is retained as
  a major issue.
    - Status of this bug can be tracked here, #1465123
