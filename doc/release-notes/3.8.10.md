# Release notes for Gluster 3.8.10

This is a bugfix release. The [Release Notes for 3.8.0](3.8.0.md),
[3.8.1](3.8.1.md), [3.8.2](3.8.2.md), [3.8.3](3.8.3.md), [3.8.4](3.8.4.md),
[3.8.5](3.8.5.md), [3.8.6](3.8.6.md), [3.8.7](3.8.7.md), [3.8.8](3.8.8.md) and
[3.8.9](3.8.9.md) contain a listing of all the new features that were added and
bugs fixed in the GlusterFS 3.8 stable release.


## Improved configuration with additional 'virt' options

This release includes 5 more options to group virt (for VM workloads) for
optimal performance.

Updating to the glusterfs version containing this patch won't automatically set
these newer options on already existing volumes that have group virt
configured. The changes take effect only when post-upgrade

    # gluster volume-set <VOL> group virt

is performed.

For already existing volumes the users may execute the following five commands,
if not already set:

    # gluster volume set <VOL> performance.low-prio-threads 32
    # gluster volume set <VOL> cluster.locking-scheme granular
    # gluster volume set <VOL> features.shard on
    # gluster volume set <VOL> cluster.shd-max-threads 8
    # gluster volume set <VOL> cluster.shd-wait-qlength 10000
    # gluster volume set <VOL> user.cifs off

It is most likely that `features.shard` would already have been set on the
volume even before the upgrade, in which case the third `volume set` command
above may be skipped.
