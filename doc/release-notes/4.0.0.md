# Release notes for Gluster 4.0.0

** DRAFT DRAFT ! DRAFT !!!**

**Header for the release - TBD**

The most notable features and changes are documented on this page. A full list
of bugs that have been addressed is included further below.

- [Major changes and features](#major-changes-and-features)
- [Major issues](#major-issues)
- [Bugs addressed in the release](#bugs-addressed)

Further, as 3.13 is a short term maintenance release, features included
in that release are available with 4.0.0 as well, and could be of interest to
users upgrading to 4.0.0 from older than 3.13 releases. The 3.13 [release notes](http://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/release-notes/)
captures the list of features that were introduced with 3.13.

**NOTE:** As 3.13 was a short term maintenance release, it will reach end of
life (EOL) with the release of 4.0.0. ([reference](https://www.gluster.org/release-schedule/))

### Management

#### 1. GlusterD2
**Notes for users:**
- Need GD2 team to fill in enough links and information here covering,
    - What it is
    - Install and configuration steps
    - Future plans (what happens in 4.1.0 and further)

**Limitations:**

**Known Issues:**

### Monitoring

The lack of live monitoring support on top of GlusterFS till date was a
limiting factor for many users (and in many cases for developers too).
[Statedump](docs.gluster.org/en/latest/Troubleshooting/statedump/) did some work of helping during debugging, but was heavy for
live monitoring.

Further, the existence of `debug/io-stats` translator was not known to many and
`gluster volume profile` was not recommended as it took a hit on performance.

With this release, glusterfs's core infrastructure itself gets some mechanisms
to provide internal information, that avoids the heavy weight nature of prior
monitoring mechanisms.

#### 1. Metrics collection across every FOP in every xlator
**Notes for users:**
Gluster, with this release, has in-built latency measures in the xlator
abstraction, thus enabling capture of metrics and usage patterns across
workloads.

These measures are currently enabled by default.

**Limitations:**
This feature is auto-enabled and cannot be disabled.

Providing means to disable the same in future releases also may not be made
available, as the data generated is deemed critical to understand and
troubleshoot gluster usage patterns.

#### 2. Monitoring support
**Notes for users:**
Currently, only project which consumes the metrics and provides basic
monitoring is [glustermetrics](https://github.com/amarts/glustermetrics), which provides a good idea on how to
utilize the metrics dumped from the processes.

Users can send SIGUSR2 signal to the process to dump the metrics, in
`/var/run/gluster/metrics/` directory.

**Limitations:**
Currently core gluster stack and memory management systems dump metrics. For
other translators and other core components, framework to provide more metrics
exists, but additional metrics are not added in this release.

### Performance
#### 1. EC: Make metadata [F]GETXATTR operations faster
**Notes for users:**
Optimized getxattr and fgetxattr in disperse volumes to speed up the operation.
Disperse translator, now forwards the request to one of the bircks that is
deemed to have a good copy, instead of all, thus improving the efficiency of the
operation.

#### 2. To make md-cache capable to serve nameless lookup
**Notes for users:**

#### 3. md-cache: Allow runtime addition of xattrs to the list of xattrs that md-cache caches
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/297
- Needs user documentation for option performance.xattr-cache-list
- Release notes:
    - Need documentation of the option, and also some details of when to use this feature
    - Maybe better if this appeared in the documentation and we could point to the same

    - Are end users going to use the status command here?
    - Documentation update?
- Release notes:
    - If there is no end user impact, no specific notes are needed for the same

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

#### 2. Enhance Geo-replication to use Volinfo from Config file
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/396

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

#### 5. Improve gsyncd configuration and arguments handling
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/73
- Release notes:
    - Needs user facing documentation for newer options and such
    - There seems to be code improvement as well in the patches, so that may not be needed in the release notes

### Standalone
#### 1. Ability to force permissions while creating files/directories on a volume
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/301
- Adds options,
    - "create-mask" and "create-directory-mask"
    - "force-create-mode" and "force-create-directory"
    - End user documentation is required
- Release notes:
    - Need a summary of what the option would enable and how to set the same
    - If relevant user documentation is added, we maybe able to point to the same as well

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

#### 2. Replace MD5 usage to enable FIPS support
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/230
- Need a lot of context on options and versions before which this feature can be used
- Release notes:
    - Need help from authors to complete

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

#### 3. Dentry fop serializer xlator on brick stack
**Notes for users:**
This feature strengthens consistency of the file system, trading it for some
performance and is strongly suggested for workloads where consistency is
required.

For use-cases that involve a large number of renames or frequent creations and
deletions, the meta-data about the files and directories shared across the
clients were not always consistent. They do eventually become consistent, but
a large proportion of applications are not built to handle eventual consistency.

This feature can be enabled as follows,
```
# gluster volume set <volname> features.sdfs enable
```

**Limitations:**
This feature is released as a preview, as performance implications are not known
completely.

#### 4. Add option to disable nftw() based deletes when purging the landfill directory
**Notes for users:**
The gluster brick processes use an optimized manner of deleting entire sub-trees
using the nftw call. With this release, an option is being added to toggle this
behavior in cases where this optimization is not desired.

This is not an exposed option, and needs to be controlled using the volume
graph. Adding the disable-landfill-purge option to the storage/posix translator
helps toggle this feature.

The default is always enabled, as in the older releases.

#### 5. Add option in POSIX to limit hardlinks per inode
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/370
- Release notes:
    - Use github description

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

#### 6. Enhancements for directory listing in readdirp
**Notes for users:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/239
- Potentially has some behavioral change in the way rebalance works, needs some documentation efforts there
- Release notes:
    - Note the changes in rebalance behavior, any performance gains?

**Limitations:**


**Known Issues:**

### Developer related
#### 1. xlators should not provide init(), fini() and others directly, but have class_methods
**Notes for developers:**
This release brings in a new unified manner of defining xlator methods. Which
avoids certain unwanted side-effects of the older method (like having to have
certain symbols being defined always), and helps a cleaner single point
registration mechanism for all xlator methods.

The new method, needs just a single symbol in the translator code to be exposed,
which is named xlator_api.

The elements of this structure is defined [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/xlator.h#L1055) and an example usage of the
same can be seen [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/commit/5b4b25c697f93d3dfe352013a442f2ec73fd3b8b).

The older mechanism is still supported, but not preferred.

#### 2. Framework for distributed testing
**Notes for developers:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/374
- Developer README already present
- Release notes:
    - Can be handled by the release team

#### 3. New API for acquiring mandatory locks
**Notes for developers:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/393
- Code comment for API exists, and release notes can point to that
- Release notes:
    - Can be handled by the release team

#### 4. New on-wire protocol (XDR) needed to support iattx and cleaner dictionary structure
**Notes for developers:**
With changes in the code to adapt to a newer iatt structure, and stricter data
format enforcement within dictionaries passed across the wire, and also as a
part of reducing technical debt around the RPC layer, this release introduces a
new RPC Gluster protocol version (4.0.0).

Typically this does not impact any development, other than to ensure that newer
RPCs that are added would need to be on the 4.0.0 version of the protocol and
dictionaries on the wire need to be better encoded.

The newer iatt structure can be viewed [here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/iatt.h#L47).

An example of better encoding dictionary values for wire transfers can be seen
[here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/release-4.0/libglusterfs/src/dict.c#L2454).

[Here](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/blob/master/doc/developer-guide/rpc-for-glusterfs.new-versions.md) is some additional information on Gluster RPC programs for the inquisitive.

#### 5. Leases support on GlusterFS
**Notes for developers:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/350
- Developer documentation is available in the header file
- Release notes:
    - Can be handled by the release team

#### 6. The protocol xlators should prevent sending binary values in a dict over the networks
**Notes for developers:**
- https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/203
- Release notes:
    - Point to developer documentation if any

#### 7. Translator to handle 'global' options
**Notes for developers:**
GlusterFS process has around 50 command line arguments to itself. While many of
the options are initial settings, many others can change its value in volume
lifetime. Prior to this release there was no way to change a setting, other than
restarting the process for many of these options.

With the introduction of global option translator, it is now possible to handle
these options without restarts.

If contributing code that adds to the process options, strongly consider adding
the same to the global option translator. An example is provided [here](https://review.gluster.org/18316).
