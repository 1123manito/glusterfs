## Major changes and features

### Brick multiplexing
*Notes for users:*

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Support to display op-version information from clients
*Notes for users:*

To get information on what op-version are supported by the clients, users can
invoke the `gluster volume status` command for clients. Along with information
on hostname, port, bytes read, bytes written and number of clients connected
per brick, we now also get the op-version on which the respective clients
operate. Following is the example usage:

```bash
# gluster volume status <VOLNAME|all> clients
```

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Support to get maximum op-version in a heterogeneous cluster
*Notes for users:*

A heterogeneous cluster operates on a common op-version that can be supported
across all the nodes in the trusted storage pool. Upon upgrade of the nodes in
the cluster, the cluster might support a higher op-version. Users can retrieve
the maximum op-version to which the cluster could be bumped up to by invoking
the `gluster volume get` command on the newly introduced global option,
`cluster.max-op-version`. The usage is as follows:

```bash
# gluster volume get all cluster.max-op-version
```

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Support for rebalance time to completion estimation
*Notes for users:*

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Separation of tier as its own service
*Notes for users:*

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Switch to storhaug for HA for NFS-Ganesha and SAMBA
*Notes for users:*
storhaug has been packaged in Fedora and soon in the CentOS Storage SIG.

*Limitations:*
glusterd doesn't yet use storhaug.
storhaug packages are not yet available for Debian, Ubuntu or SuSE.

*Known Issues:*
Packaging (glusterfs.spec(.in)) has no dependency on the storhaug rpm.
glusterd still starts ganesha.nfsd using systemctl or init.d equivalent.
glusterd still tries to invoke ganesha-ha.sh to setup and teardown HA.

### Statedump support for gfapi based applications
*Notes for users:*

*Limitations:*

*Known Issues:*

### Disabled creation of trash directory by default
*Notes for users:*

*Limitations:*
