# Release notes for Gluster 3.8.6

This is a bugfix release. The [Release Notes for 3.8.0](3.8.0.md),
[3.8.1](3.8.1.md), [3.8.2](3.8.2.md), [3.8.3](3.8.3.md), [3.8.4](3.8.4.md) and
[3.8.5](3.8.5.md) contain a listing of all the new features that were added and
bugs fixed in the GlusterFS 3.8 stable release.


## Change in port allocation, may affect deployments with strict firewalls

'''Problem description''': GlusterD used to assume that the brick port which
was previously allocated to a brick, would still be available, and in doing so
would reuse the port for the brick without registering with the port map
server. The port map server would not be aware of the brick reusing the same
port, and try to allocate it to another process, and in turn result in that
process' failure to connect to the port.

'''Fix and port usage changes''': With the fix, we force GlusterD to unregister
a port previously used by the brick, and register a new port with the port map
server and then use it. As a result of this change, there will be no conflict
between processes competing over the same port, thereby fixing the issue. Also
because of this change, a brick process on restart is not guaranteed to reuse
the same port it used to be connected to.
